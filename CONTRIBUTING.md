### Overview

We use GitHub Issues for issue tracking, including bug reports, feature requests and questions.

We accept patches via GitHub Pull Requests. Please fork our repo, make your changes, commit them to a feature branch and *submit a PR to have it merged back into this project*. We'll give feedback and get it merged ASAP.

### Contact

Please use public, documented communication instead of reaching out to developers 1-1.

Open Source projects benefit from always communicating in the open. Other people may run into the same issue, search for a similar trace and find your question and their answer. More eyes may even get your question answered faster.

#### Issues

Please use our GitHub Issues freely, even for small things. They are the primary method by which we track what's going on in the project.

The lables assigned to an issue can tell you important things about it.

For example, issues tagged `good-for-beginners` are likely to not require much background knowledge and be fairly self-contained, perfect for people new to the project who are looking to get involved.

The priority-related issue labels (`prio:high`, `piro:normal`...) are also important to note. They typically accurately reflect the next TODOs the community will complete.

The `info:progress` labels may not always be up-to-date, but will be used when appropriate (typically long-standing issues that take multiple commits).

Issues can be referenced and manipulated from git commit messages. Just referencing the issue's number (`#42`) will link the commit and issue. Issues can also be closed from commit messages with `closes #42` (and [a verity of other key words](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).
